This is an introductory document to fx, an application
with supporting packages providing users of the Fossil SCM with
extended management facilities going beyond the regular command line.</p>
<p>It is one in a set of related examples demonstrating the
abilities of the system. The interested reader can then go on into to

</div>
<div id="section3" class="section"><h2><a name="section3">Solution to the Example</a></h2>
<div id="subsection1" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection1">Basics</a></h3>
<p>With full access to the main fossil project file there is no need for
the basic setup a remote user has to go through to see the necessary
configuration information.</p>
<p>We can jump directly to configuring mailing and routing.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection2" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection2">Sending Mail</a></h3>
<p>First we deal with the mail configuration. This is all about which
host to use for injecting mail into the network, on which port,
encrypted or not, the necessary credentials, etc.</p>
<p>Here are the relevant commands:</p>
<pre class="example">
    fx repository set /path/to/the/fossil/repository/file
    fx note config set host     your-mail-host
    fx note config set user     your-mail-username
    fx note config set password your-mail-password
    fx note config set sender   your-project-maintainer-email-address
    fx note config set location your-projects-base-url
    fx note config export /path/to/mail-config-backup
    fx repository reset
</pre>
<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul class="itemized">
<li><p>The example uses the <b class="cmd">fx repository set|reset</b> commands
	to avoid typing</p>
<pre class="example">
    -R /path/to/the/fossil/repository/file
</pre>
<p>in each configuration command of the example. This is just visual
clutter. In actual script it is recommended to use <b class="option">-R</b>
however, as this allows the parallel execution of the script for
different repositories. The set|reset commands involve global state,
the &quot;default repository&quot;, which forces serialization to avoid the
script instances from intefering with each other.</p></li>
<li><p>The attributes <i class="term">host</i>, <i class="term">user</i>, and <i class="term">password</i>
should be self-explanatory. They are the mail host to talk to, as
specified by your network administrator and/or ISP, and the
credentials it expects to allow access.</p>
<p>There is a <i class="term">port</i> attribte as well, which needs to be set
if and only if a non-standard port is used for SMTP.</p>
<p>Similarly the <i class="term">tls</i> attribute (a boolean) has to be set
only if the mail system requires a TLS/SSL-encrypted connection.</p></li>
<li><p>The value of <i class="term">sender</i> should be some thought put
into.
This email address will appear as the 'From' header in all generated
mails. If a receiver of some notification has an issue they will
likely respond to this address.
Mail delivery errors, i.e. bounces will be sent to this address as
well.
Lastly, fx will send the stacktraces of all internal
errors caught during operation there.
As such it is strongly recommended to make this a proper and valid
address, for the person or group which manages this setup.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i class="term">location</i> is used in the generated mails as the base
for the embedded links to the change artifacts, i.e. revisions, ticket
changes, tickets, wiki pages, etc.</p>
<p>In this case here, with direct access to the repository file,
this part of the configuration must be set, as it cannot be infered.</p></li>
<li><p>Of all the settings above the <i class="term">location</i> is the only one
which is a decidedly per-repository item.
For all other settings it makes sense to configure them at the global
level, to be shared across all managed repositories. Assuming that
there is more than one repository getting managed.
To do so is as simple as adding the option <b class="option">--global</b> to the
configuration commands, like</p>
<pre class="example">
    fx note config set --global host your-mail-host
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>The last command in the example, the <b class="cmd">note config export</b>
is technically not required, as it <em>only</em> makes a backup of the
configuration in a text file.</p>
<p>It is in the example due to my belief that having a backup,
always, is good policy, and to drive this belief.</p>
<p>And together with the complementary <b class="cmd">note config import</b>
command this is also another way of copying a mail setup around and
applying it to multiple repositories.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="subsection3" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection3">Routing</a></h3>
<p>Next after the low-level mail configuration we have to determine for
which events of the timeline we wish to get notifications, and where
to send them. This is called <i class="term">routing</i>.</p>
<p>For our example we go with the simplest possible setup and
declare that we are interested in all of them, and to send their
notifications to the same address. The command for that is</p>
<pre class="example">
    fx note route add all the-destination-email-address
</pre>
<p>Note that for clarity the option <b class="option">-R</b> was left out of the
command. Use either it or the &quot;default repository&quot;, as shown in the
previous section.</p>
<p>The <i class="term">all</i> argument is a catch-all term for all possible
events we might be interested in. Use the introspection command</p>
<pre class="example">
    fx note route events
</pre>
<p>to list the possible events we can use instead of <i class="term">all</i>.</p>
<p>The destination mail address can be anything, i.e. a single
person, a mail alias, a mailing list, etc. The latter would allow
people to subscribe to notifications from the repository without
having to deal directly with it.</p>
<p>The above has handled the <i class="term">static</i> routing. Destinations
for notifications which are fixed for the repository and event.</p>
<p>For ticket changes we can further configure the <i class="term">dynamic</i>
routing. This enables the system to dynamically generate mail for the
people involved in a ticket in some way, be it submitter, developer,
commenter, etc.</p>
<p>This is done by telling the system which fields of a ticket can
contain user names and/or email addresses. These are expanded through
the account information of the repository into the addresses to send
mail to, beyond the static destinations. The introspection command</p>
<pre class="example">
   fx note route fields
</pre>
<p>will print a table of all ticket fields which are available. It is the
maintainers responsibility to then declare which of them to inspect.</p>
<p>Using the Tcl core repository as an example the command declaring the
fields to inspect is:</p>
<pre class="example">
    fx note route field add assignee closer login private_contact submitter username
</pre>
<p>To capture changes to these fields themselves the system will
automatically maintain an extended per-ticket history of the declared
fields and send mail to both current and previous value of a field.</p>
<p>After the routing has been set up it is recommended to make a
backup, using</p>
<pre class="example">
    fx note route export /path/to/the/routes-backup
</pre>
<p>Having a backup is always good idea, I believe. And together with the
complementary <b class="cmd">note route import</b> command this enables us to
apply the same routing setup to multiple repositories. Especially
important as we currently do not support global shared routing.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection4" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection4">Testing</a></h3>
<p>While the setup is in principle done with the two previous sections I
believe that it is a not good idea to immediately jump to the
monitoring. Better test the setup first.
To start, a general test that the configured mail settings work:</p>
<pre class="example">
    fx test mail-setup 'Andreas Kupries &lt;andreask@activestate.com&gt;'
</pre>
<p>The command in the example sends a fixed mail to the specified
destination address, using all the settings of section
<span class="sectref"><a href="#subsection2">Sending Mail</a></span>.</p>
<p>If that is ok, do</p>
<pre class="example">
    fx note update-history
</pre>
<p>This command explicitly updates the cached history of the ticket
fields mentioning for the dynamic routing (see last section).</p>
<p>The initial run can take some time, depending on the size of
the pre-existing timeline, thus it feels nicer to me to do this
separately instead of as part of the next group of commands.</p>
<pre class="example">
    fx test manifest-parse --all
    fx test mail-receivers --all
    fx test mail-for       --all
</pre>
<p>These commands go over all the changes i nthe repository and
checks that the system is able to parse their manifests, can generate
a list of destination mail addresses for them, and generate mail for
them.</p>
<p>Any problems will be shown in the resulting table.</p>
<p>This is less of a test of the repository and setup but more a
test that the system can deal with all the data found in the
repository. This is especially useful when operating on large
repositories, like Tcl, Tk, etc. as this is essentially a stress-test
of the tool internals, with a higher probability of testing even
things which are usually not found or simply rare (like, for example,
signed manifests, huge manifests, etc).</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection5" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection5">Nearly done</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have configured all the big obvious things needed for the
generation and distribution of the notifications we have one last
thing to do:</p>
<pre class="example">
    fx note mark-notified --all -R /path/to/the/fossil/repository/file
</pre>
<p>This tells fx that we do not wish to generate and send
notification mails for everything which is already in the timeline of
the project at this moment.
This is <em>especially important</em> when setting up the
notifications for a project which has already run for some time.
The project's developers and ticket submitters will most emphatically
not wish to receive a deluge of emails for changes which have already
been done in the past.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection6" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection6">Go</a></h3>
<p>With all the preparatory work finally done we can go and start the
monitoring. Note however that fx does not fully do
everything by itself.</p>
<p>It assumes that it will be called from a cron job, i.e. that
all the timing-related things are handled by the system, as is the
prevention of multiple parallel notification runs, and where log files
will be located.</p>
<p>As we have full access to the master fossil repository file of
the project the only fx command we need in the core job
script is <b class="cmd">note deliver</b>, i.e.</p>
<pre class="example">
    fx note deliver -R /path/to/the/fossil/repository/file
</pre>
<p>Getting new content and configuration changes, as is required
for remote operation is not needed in this case.</p>
