- All tools replicate some code to access the shared state file.
  Should be in a small package instead.  Or merge all the scripts into
  a single tool.

- The database schema is not fully baked.  I currently have artifact
  --(n:1)-- repository and equate repository with project.  This does
  not account for multiple repositories (mirrors) of a project.  And
  for robustness watching multiple mirrors of a project is likely
  sensible.

- Artifacts are marked as seen even if the sending of their mail
  fails. No idea yet of how to deal with multiple destinations
  associated with a repo where some are ok, and some fail.

- Long term idea: Make the mail multipart/mixed and use the /tinfo
  link for the artifact s source for the text/html part. I.e. send the
  change artifact rendered as html by fossil itself in the mail.

- The type=t filtering of the timeline.rss seems to be broken in fossil.
