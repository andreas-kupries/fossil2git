Watch scripts
=============

watch-init
watch-final

	System setup and destruction.
	init contains the database schema.

watch-config-get   ?key?
watch-config-set   <key> <value>
watch-config-unset <key>

	Query and modify the global configuration.
	Make sure to never unset one of the predefined
	settings. The system needs them.

watch-setup   <url> <from>
watch-destroy <url>

	Add/remove repositories to/from the system.
	<from> is the sender address used in generated mails.

watch-add    <url> <to>
watch-remove <url> <to>

	Add/remove receiver addresses to/from a repository.
	Note that repositories without a receiver are ignored.

watch-list

	Show currently known repositories with sender and receiver
	information.

watch-do ?dry|no-mail...?

	Run a check on all repositories, detect new tickets, send mail.
	Touch all artifacts as seen, tickets or not, and update their
	access time.

	"Dry" disables saving of seen artifacts into the state. A
	future run of watch-do will consider them again.

	"No-mail" disables the generation of mails. Good for an
	initial run of watch-do to front-load the table of seen
	artifacts with past changes.

watch-expire

	Run a check for expired artifacts and remove them.
	See the global configuration for the threshold.

watch-cron

	Convenience script packaging do and expire for cron, with
	locking against concurrent execution, and logging into a file.
	(Logging is append-only, use logrotate or similar to keep
	growth in check).

watch-unsee <artifact>

	Drop artifact from seen table, forcing mail regeneration.

watch-rss <url> <n>
watch-dump <url> <artifact>

	Tools to inspect the rss timeline and specific artifacts of a
	repository.
