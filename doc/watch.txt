Watch scripts
=============

watch-init

	init contains the database schema.

watch-config-get   ?key?
watch-config-set   <key> <value>
watch-config-unset <key>

	Query and modify the global configuration.
	Make sure to never unset one of the predefined
	settings. The system needs them.

watch-setup   <url> <from>
watch-destroy <url>

	Add/remove repositories to/from the system.
	<from> is the sender address used in generated mails.

watch-add    <url> <to>

	Add/remove receiver addresses to/from a repository.
	Note that repositories without a receiver are ignored.

watch-list

	Show currently known repositories with sender and receiver
	information.

watch-do

	Run a check on all repositories, detect new tickets, send mail.
	Touch all artifacts as seen, tickets or not, and update their
	access time.

watch-expire

	Run a check for expired artifacts and remove them.
	See the global configuration for the threshold.

watch-cron

	Convenience script packaging do and expire for cron, with
	locking against concurrent execution, and logging into a file.
	(Logging is append-only, use logrotate or similar to keep
	growth in check).
