- The configuration used to access mail is current hardwired in
  watch-do.  See proc "config".  This should be put into the shared
  state, with scripts to query and modify.  Extension: Allow this to
  be both global and per-project/repository

- I plan to add a mail header X-Fossil-Ticket-Note to the sent mails,
  to make filtering/sorting easier.

- I currently use n=200 for querying the timeline. That is something
  we might wish to configure, either globally, or on a per project
  basis.

- The table of seen artifacts in the shared state can currently grow
  out of bounds. There is no code yet to wipe old entries we are sure
  to not see again anymore. (Could be done with a last-touched
  timestamp which is always updated, even if no mail is sent, or not a
  ticket.  Then, when an artifact falls out of the .rss it is not
  getting touched anymore and we can wipe anything older than some
  global threshold (Say, 30 days ?)

- The sent mail's subject is currently not very informative.  It is
  especially not showing the title of a ticket.  To get this I believe
  I need a local clone of the watched repository I can then directly
  access via sqlite (ticket tables).  (And the field to use, like
  'title' likely has to be configured on a per-project/repository
  basis)

- watch-do does not lock against multiple concurrent runs. Ok, for
  this I prefer to make a helper script which handles the locking and
  is the main script used in cron.
